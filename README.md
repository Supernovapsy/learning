This repository is for experimenting with the features of Git.

Let's answer some fundamental questions and see how the answer progresses with time:
1. Why am I using Git?
2. What can I use Git for?
3. How can I use Git for my own development and the development of others?
4. Who do I want my repository to be seen by?
