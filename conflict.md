One should be curious about the world
One should respect the classic traditions
One should put hard work to learning the fundamental traditions
One should make efforts to practise and appreciate the traditions
One should be humble

On the other hand...
One should be excited about the world
One should be optimistic
One should be courageous to action
One should be proud of his accomplishments.
